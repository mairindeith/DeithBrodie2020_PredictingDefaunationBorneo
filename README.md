# Repository information

This repo contains all code from Deith and Brodie, 2020 - "Predicting defaunation â€“ accurately mapping bushmeat hunting pressure over large areas". 

Script files are organized into folders based on their function. 

1. **Creation of a resistance surface**
  - [ResistanceMapGeneration.py]() - using geospatial data layers with the same extent and resolution, performs calculations based on a. landcover, b. slope (from a digital elevation model), c. roadways, and d. rivers and stream order (from a digital elevation model).  
  
2. **Circuit-theory based simulations across the resistance surface** (using [GFLOW software by Leonard et al.](https://github.com/gflow/GFlow))
  - [GRASS_IsochroneSampler.py]() - using settlement location geospatial data layer (as a .shp file), create GFLOW-specific source and sink node files (in .txt and .tsv format) to use as input to GFLOW simulations. This Python script must be run within an interactive GRASS session's terminal.
  - [CircuitTheoreticMapCreation_GFLOW.sh]() - modification of script from [GFLOW](https://github.com/gflow/GFlow) to loop iteratively over the source-sink pairs created with `GRASS_IsochroneSampler.py`. Output maps are created and modified according to local population density (inserted into the file names of the `.txt` and `.tsv` files created in the `GRASS_IsochroneSampler.py`). 
  - [GFLOWOutput_Summation.py]() - this script iterates through output files created with `CircuitTheoreticMapCreation_GFLOW.sh`, modifies the outputs of these files based on population density at each source village, and sums these into a final cumulative .tif map of circuit-theoretic accessibility for all source-sink pairings. This may need to be modified if the ouputs of `CircuitTheoreticMapCreation_GFLOW.sh` are modified within the shell script. 

3. **N-mixture model creation and assessment**
  - [NmixmodelWorkflow.R]() - an R file which contains all steps of the N-mixture model creation process (broken down into individual files in the subfolder `NMixModel_Steps`):
    - [main.R]() - identical to the workflow script, this will run all stages of analysis by sourcing the following scripts:
    - [functions.R]() - helper functions that are used later in the 
    - [load.R]() - load the raw data for covariates in the N-mixture models
    - [clean.R]() - cleans input data and prepares it in the correct format for N-mixture model fitting 
    - [modelfitting.R]() - given a list of covariates, automatically creates formulae for N-mixture model and fits these models (designed to run on a cluster).
