# Respository `DeithBrodie2020_HuntingAccessibility_MSYBorneo`

This repo contains all code from Deith and Brodie, 2020 - "Predicting defaunation â€“ accurately mapping bushmeat hunting pressure over large areas". 

Script files contained in this repo can be broken down into three steps of the analysis:

1. **Creation of a resistance surface**
2. **Circuit-theory based simulations across the resistance surface** (using [GFLOW software by Leonard et al.](https://github.com/gflow/GFlow))
3. **N-mixture model creation and assessment**
